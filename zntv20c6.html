      <h1 class="center">Volume20 Chapter 6: Joint Committee on Holy Land Restoration</h1><br><p>The capital of Gallia, Lutèce. A meeting about forming the &#39;Joint Armies of Holy Land Restoration&#39; was being held in the Versailles Palace located in the suburbs.</p>

<p>Sitting in the main seat of the spacious conference hall was the pope, Vittorio Serevare. Julio, acting as the pope&#39;s assistant, stood behind him like his shadow.</p>

<p>The recently crowned queen of Gallia, Josette, ceded the main seat to the pope and sat on the right side even though this land was her dominion.</p>

<p>However, she was currently occupying the throne under the name, &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;. Josette was actually the twin sister of Charlotte, also known as Tabitha, but to avoid strife, this fact has not been made known to the public.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Henrietta sat on the left side of the pope. On her side was the Germanian emperor, Albrecht III.</p>

<p>Generals and ministers from each nation took the rest of the seats all the way to the other end of the table.</p>

<p>A heavy atmosphere hung in the conference hall. The first one to break the silence, was Albrecht III of Germania.</p>

<p>&quot;Your highness, I have a few things that need some explaining, would that be alright?&quot;</p>

<p>Albrecht said, maintaining his haughtiness before the pope,</p>

<p>&quot;Please go on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since we are discussing about creating the joint army to reclaim the Holy Land, do we really have a chance of winning if we just attacked the elves head-on?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is not about having a chance of winning or not. We&#39;re about to lose our homes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if you say that, if we were to simply declare war without thinking it through, it won&#39;t end well for us. You should know that doing this recklessly will not only cause our destruction, but also accelerate our own extinction.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We have a trump card of our own.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah.&quot;</p>

<p>Albrecht III deflated immediately.</p>

<p>&quot;And what will that be, exactly? I&#39;ve heard rumours around. About the revival of the real &#39;Void Users&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s exactly so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The legendary element, &#39;Void&#39;. If this is true...&quot;</p>

<p>Albrecht looked around him, only to see that everyone looked serious. Mm... He nodded while stroking his beard.</p>

<p>&quot;So it&#39;s true then.&quot;</p>

<p>After that, he put on a serious expression himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Why aren&#39;t you surprised?&quot;</p>

<p>Henrietta asked, a little shocked.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you wish for me to be surprised?&quot;</p>

<p>Henrietta hung her head in shame after he said that. She had always treated him as a fool in her mind.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I mean, in this day and age we have continents floating up into the air, so it isn&#39;t a stretch that legends turn out to be real. However, it&#39;s too early to placate me with just this fact. I&#39;m not the same as the likes of you.&quot;</p>

<p>Albrecht III said that with the cold expression of a realist. He knew very well of the running joke that his country, Germania, was a country of nouveau riche boors. However, it was clear from his face that his aspirations never faltered in spite of the contempt others had for his people.</p>

<p>&quot;In other words, you want to see the real power of the &#39;Void&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p>Albrecht III&#39;s mouth curved up in a smile, as if he had been waiting for this question all along.</p>

<p>&quot;It not only had the power to destroy the Albion air fleet completely, but it also could create large scale mirages in the air... Indeed, that&#39;s very impressive. However, we still don&#39;t know if this is even effective against the elves.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Doesn&#39;t everyone here know that this is the power of the &#39;Void&#39;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even for me, I have only witnessed it from far. However, as far as I know, it isn&#39;t possible to use the &#39;Explosion&#39; spell that had destroyed the Albion air fleet anymore. This is due to the fact that using it will use up one&#39;s mental will! I&#39;m not wrong, am I? I can&#39;t believe that such previous mental will was wasted in our infighting.&quot;</p>

<p>Henrietta looked at the pope uncomfortably. To tell the truth, she had similar doubts. The &#39;Void&#39; magic that Louise and the pope was able to use was very strong, but would they still be able to use it against the elves in such a liberal manner?</p>

<p>There was also the question of how effective it would be if they used it.</p>

<p>In addition to that, Saito and Tiffania had been captured. Louise had also left to save them. In this case, there were only two &#39;Void Users&#39; left, the pope and Josette. Was this really enough to form the joint army and reclaim the &#39;Holy Land&#39;?</p>

<p>Albrecht III continued to press on and said,</p>

<p>&quot;Your Holiness, what do you think is the determining factor in a war? Diplomacy and strategies... might be what you were thinking about, but these are all useless. It is only power, raw power that determines the victor of a war. I only want to know, if we are the ones holding that sort of power.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your Holiness, I agree with what Germania has said.&quot;</p>

<p>Henrietta was also thinking of the same thing.</p>

<p>&quot;Not only that, we also have a lack of &#39;Void Users&#39;. Are we really able to win against the elves like this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is no need to worry about this. We have already set in motion plans of our own.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is this true?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I&#39;ve already sent someone skilled on that.&quot;</p>

<p>Henrietta was extremely worried about them. For Henrietta, they weren&#39;t mere pawns of war, but her trusted friends.</p>

<p>If it were possible...</p>

<p>Since they were &quot;captured&quot;, it means the elves did not plan to kill them. What about Louise, who had entered the land of the elves? She did not get captured too, did she?</p>

<p>&quot;I should have stopped her then, even if I had to tie her up by the neck&quot;, Henrietta thought as she chewed her lip.</p>

<p>&quot;Could you please inform me as soon as possible if there are any new developments?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly. Well then, I shall answer your questions. Even if the four of us could not come together, our own magic is still very powerful. However, since we can not use this magic at a whim, I can only ask you to trust us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And how do you expect us to do that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Gallian Queen, Josette, sitting has the power to cast a much powerful &#39;Explosion&#39; spell than what Miss Valiere had done back then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, you&#39;re saying that that spell can be used again without fail? And it will be of an even bigger scale?&quot;</p>

<p>Josette, who has been silent the whole time, finally spoke up.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I&#39;ve learnt a few new spells, even if I have not cast them before. However, there is no mistaking this powerful feeling I have within me. As for its power...&quot;</p>

<p>There was a short moment of silence in the hall.</p>

<p>&quot;Can we take that as proof that you will not renege on your words?&quot;</p>

<p>Josette smiled when she heard such a question.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if my performance can&#39;t satisfy you, then I shall cede half of my country to Germania. However, that is made under the assumption that we both still have land to rule over after this is over.&quot;</p>

<p>Albrecht III shot a death glare at Josette before taking in a deep breath.</p>

<p>&quot;...Alright, I&#39;ll put my faith in your words.&quot;</p>

<p>Vittorio smiled as he nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then. We will be going deep into enemy lines to save our &#39;brothers&#39;, before reorganizing ourselves into a larger force and go straight for the capital of Nephthys to reclaim our &#39;Holy Land&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After that, we would be able to activate the dormant magic device, and save Halkeginia from its current crisis. Is that correct?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Henrietta&#39;s sharp eyes caught a flash of gloom on Vittorio&#39;s face.</p>

<p>&quot;...In other words, I could only wait for Louise and the others to return?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is all you need to do.&quot;, the pope said with a tense face,</p>

<p>&quot;We will create an diversion to increase our chances of success. We must attack them with haste!&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing the pope&#39;s high-spirited words made Albrecht III laugh out heartily.</p>

<p>&quot;Did I say anything strange?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, not at all. It just that, hearing such fiery words eased my mind. I see, nothing ventured, nothing gained. Alright then, I&#39;ll do it. No matter what, we don&#39;t have a choice anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alright then, I will leave the details of forming the joint army to you two.&quot;</p>

<p>Having said that, Vittorio stood up. However, he noticed that Henrietta still looked distressed.</p>

<p>&quot;Is there anything worrying you?&quot;</p>

<p>Vittorio asked.</p>

<p>&quot;No...&quot; Henrietta shook her head. Vittorio then left with Julio. Josette left shortly after them.</p>

<p>Henrietta watched Vittorio leave. She felt that he was hiding something from her.</p>

<p>&quot;This man, has concealed something from us, and it seems to be something important.&quot;</p>

<p>Vittorio pressed his temple after he has returned to the room that had been prepared for him. He seemed to be thinking about something, and shook his head.</p>

<p>Julio smiled and spoke as he noticed his master&#39;s antics.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you exhausted?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s still early.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know, sometimes I&#39;d like to just say the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How I would like to tell them that the &#39;magic device&#39; doesn&#39;t exist at all, or that even if the four legendary familiars come together and use the absolute &#39;Void Magic&#39;, we still wouldn&#39;t be able to prevent the land from rising to the air.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, how carefully we guard these truths.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And yet we&#39;re still claiming to retake the &#39;Holy Land&#39;... No, because of that, that&#39;s exactly what we should do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah.&quot;</p>

<p>Vittorio nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;A battle in hell awaits.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Agreed.&quot;</p>

<p>The both of them looked at each other after that before breaking into sardonic laughter.</p>

<p>&quot;Will we, be able to cope with all this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We don&#39;t really know, until we&#39;ve tried it.&quot;</p>

<p>Just as they were having such an conversation, Josette pouted as she said, &quot;What&#39;re you guys babbling about? Isn&#39;t today an important day?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;</p>

<p>Vittorio and Julio stopped laughing as they turned serious again.</p>

<p>Julio asked Josette, &quot;Are you ready?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ve prepared everything. I don&#39;t plan to let anyone except Julio to be my familiar anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>Vittorio gently reminded her, &quot;Josette, Julio is already my familiar, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I knew that. However, didn&#39;t your Holiness said before? A strong sense of longing, has the power to pull a familiar to my side.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A long time before, when founder Brimir was summoning the fourth familiar... he managed to &#39;Re-summon&#39; the elf girl who had already become a familiar. That&#39;s definitely because founder Brimir&#39;s loved her dearly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, exactly so.&quot; Vittorio said so as he was reminded of something he wrote on the &quot;Legacy&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right.</p>

<p>During the time when founder Brimir summoned the last familiar, he successfully summoned the elf girl Sasha, who had already become Gandálfr.</p>

<p>&quot;The familiar of &#39;Zero&#39;, will only be summoned through two means. The first is &#39;fate&#39;, and the second is &#39;love&#39;. Am I right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, it would be perfect if Julio became my familiar. Meeting Julio back in Saint Margarita&#39;s was my fate. Not only that, there is no one who loves Julio more than I do. This feeling of mine will never be lesser than what founder Brimir had felt.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it really that powerful?&quot; Julio asked with a mocking tone.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey! Don&#39;t you believe me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No... It&#39;s just that it&#39;s too hard to love someone that strongly. Maybe you&#39;ve never thought that you actually don&#39;t love me that much. Didn&#39;t they say the love is just like measles. It goes as fast as it comes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In other words, I&#39;m obsessed with the idea of loving you? You&#39;re trying to say that this feeling of mine, is not &#39;love&#39;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, that&#39;s not what I meant. I just want to say that the feeling of yours might not be that strong. Hey, Josette, I&#39;m only saying this because I&#39;m worried about you. Wouldn&#39;t you be devastated if the familiar you summoned isn&#39;t me?&quot;</p>

<p>After hearing this, Josette&#39;s expression turned somber.</p>

<p>&quot;Devastated? If, the familiar I summoned isn&#39;t you, I will end my life right here and now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, don&#39;t make such jokes...&quot;</p>

<p>Julio suddenly noticed how serious Josette looked when she was saying this.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m not joking about this. Isn&#39;t this what loving someone means? I have already decided this when I left Saint Margarita&#39;s. I will follow you all my life, because I love you. If my love for you isn&#39;t real, then that would also mean that my determination then was a lie. For me, there is no point in continuing such a life.&quot;</p>
      <div class="center"><img src="img/ZnT20_157.jpg.jpg"></div><p>Josette took out a pistol that was hidden in her dress.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Josette, that is not a toy, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If, I can&#39;t summon you, if I&#39;m unable to make the &#39;Gate&#39; appear here, I&#39;ll shoot myself.&quot;</p>

<p>Julio silently thought about how he was going to remove the pistol from Josette&#39;s grasp.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t come any further. Take one more step forward, and I will blast my head open immediately.&quot;</p>

<p>Vittorio watched her with amusement and laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;ve lost, Julio.&quot;</p>

<p>Julio could only shake his head, troubled. He then swiftly unsheathed his sword.</p>

<p>&quot;I understand. If the one that you summon is not me, then I will slit my throat with this sword.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is none of your business. This is only about the sincerity of my &#39;love&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You naive child. The sincerity of your &#39;love&#39;, is also important to me. If the &#39;love&#39; you speak of is not real, then there is no meaning for me to continue living.&quot;</p>

<p>A tear emerged from Josette&#39;s eye as she heard this. She was so touched that she could only mumble,</p>

<p>&quot;I love you, Julio.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love you too, Josette.&quot;</p>

<p>Josette held the gun in her left hand as she lowered her head and chanted the spell. The runic melody of the &#39;Summon&#39; spell filled the air around her...</p>

<p>Julio and Vittorio stayed hushed until the spell chanting was complete.</p>

<p>After that, Josette gingerly waved her wand. Even though only a few seconds has passed, Julio and Josette felt as if they have experienced an eternity.</p>

<p>With a crack in the air, as if to shatter the grave atmosphere surrounding them, a gate appeared in front of Julio... Josette collapsed to the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;Josette!&quot;</p>

<p>Julio rushed to Josette&#39;s side anxiously, and carried her up. Josette gradually open her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m just exhausted...&quot;</p>

<p>Julio snatched the gun away from her, and threw it to the corner.</p>

<p>&quot;You foolish girl! Were you really going to die if the gate is not opened?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course I was.&quot;</p>

<p>Julio stood up, and walked through the &#39;Gate&#39;. He appeared before Josette again. It looked just like he went through a plane of light.</p>

<p>Just as Josette wanted to kiss Julio, he stopped her.</p>

<p>&quot;What happened?&quot;</p>

<p>However, Julio did not answer her and instead looked at Vittorio.</p>

<p>&quot;If no runes appeared on my chest, then that would be the case, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. However, we could say there is zero chance for that not to happen. Josette substituted King Joseph as the new the &#39;Void User&#39;, and as such, the familiar should heed her summons.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just like how Miss Valiére had Gandálfr?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Then I&#39;m relieved. I don&#39;t fear dying for the Church, but I do have plenty of things that I&#39;ve always wanted to do.&quot;</p>

<p>Josette looked confused and asked,</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>Julio remained silent for a while before shaking his head.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s nothing. You don&#39;t have to worry about it, Josette. Let&#39;s proceed.&quot;</p>

<p>Josette continued chanting the spells.</p>

<p>&quot;My name is Queen Josette of Gallia. Pentagon of the Five Elemental Powers, bless this humble being, and make him my familiar...&quot;</p>

<p>And then, Josette kissed Julio.</p>

<p>Julio felt as if his forehead was burning and touched his forehead.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you okay, Julio?&quot;</p>

<p>Julio hugged Josette.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s alright... compared to the pain in my chest, this little pain on my forehead is nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>The pain on his forehead, bore the heavy truth that he was not &quot;Lífþrasir&quot;. The heavy and painful truth burned in his heart...</p>

<p>Julio&#39;s heart throbbed in agony as he spoke softly,</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;ve really, recreated founder Brimir&#39;s brilliant achievement, eh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mm, the first summon was due to &#39;fate&#39;, and the second due to &#39;love&#39;. We&#39;ve repeated the miracle where founder Brimir fell in love with his familiar.&quot;</p>

<p>Vittorio nodded satisfactorily and said,</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, the last one would be Tiffania&#39;s familiar... Ah, the irony of it all. The familiar of such a gentle girl, would be the bearer of such a cruel fate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All of these will be for us, the clan of the &#39;Magi&#39;. No matter how cruel the fate, we will always have to accept it, for the benefit of the clan.&quot;</p>

<p>Julio closed his eyes, and spoke as if he was singing,</p>

<p>&quot;How cruel this fate is, being the &#39;Void&#39; that will be revived no matter how many times we get killed.&quot;</p>

<p>Vittorio agreed with him, and said,</p>

<p>&quot;There is only one way to stop this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, we could only rely on &#39;him&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. If it were him, then he wouldn&#39;t make the same mistake as Sasha.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;True.&quot; Julio nodded his head.</p>

<p>&quot;There&#39;s nothing to be worried about. He&#39;s a guy who stood in front of seventy thousand men to block them for Miss Valiére.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In other words, a guy who would definitely die for the person he loves.&quot;</p>

<p>Julio looked out the east window.</p>

<p>&quot;If only they could successfully save him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Definitely. I hope so too.&quot;</p>
